Hotelier
===================================
This is a project generated during the internship of Works Applications 2015.
How to create project
-----------------------------------
Java Eclipse - `File` - `New` - `Java Project`<br>
`Use Default Location` - NO<br>
`Location` - `Browse` - choose the directory of this project<br>
`Finish`<br>
How to run
-----------------------------------
The main function is in the Main.class under the package "co.jp.worksap.intern.main".<br>
I provide a simple graphic user interface. I believe that it's easy to understand and use.<br>
The input file of exhibition
-----------------------------------
The only useful .csv file under the "files" directory is `STAFF_MST.csv`.<br>
Usage: Open the project - `Run` - click `Staff Manager` - click `Settings` - choose the `STAFF_MST.csv` file - click `OK` - click `Load`<br>
Then you can modify values in the form.<br>
Remember to click `Save` to save your changes. The changed form will be saved to the recent file you open, so make sure you don't need the origin file, or you have a back-up. Actually I provided a back-up.<br>
