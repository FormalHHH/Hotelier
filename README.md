Hotelier
===================================
This is a project generated during the internship of Works Applications 2015.

How to create project
-----------------------------------
Java Eclipse - `File` - `New` - `Java Project`

`Use Default Location` - NO

`Location` - `Browse` - choose the directory of this project

`Finish`

How to run
-----------------------------------
The main function is in the `Main.java` under the package `co.jp.worksap.intern.main`.

I provide a simple graphical user interface. I believe that it's easy to understand and use.

The input file of exhibition
-----------------------------------
The only useful .csv file under the "files" directory is `STAFF_MST.csv`.

Usage: Open the project - `Run` - click `Staff Manager` - click `Settings` - choose the `STAFF_MST.csv` file - click `OK` - click `Load`

Then you can modify values in the form.

Remember to click `Save` to save your changes. The changed form will be saved to the recent file you open, so make sure you don't need the origin file, or you have a back-up. Actually I provided a back-up.

What have I already realized
-----------------------------------
I have realized the Core and two functions in the Staff Management module. They are:

>Load the information of staffs from csv file, then add, delete and modify the information of staffs																				
>Autometic financial rewards&punishments calculations based on attendance record for employees and send them to the Accountant assistance																				

Further development
-----------------------------------
You may see the catalog for more information.
